# Step 1 - create basic React app
Checkout from the tutorial project:

```
git clone https://github.com/szymonmichalak/react-forms-path.git
```


Install dependencies:

```
cd react-forms-path
npm install
```

Run the app:

```
npm start
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000. If you see **"Hello React Forms!"** with very basic input, looks like everything went fine!
