# Forms in React
Learn how to use forms in React

#### Intro & requirements:
In this tutorial we assume that you are familiar with JavaScript [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and you know some basics of [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html). You will learn how to create simple forms in React and how they can be improved, step by step. There are many ready-to-use libraries like [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form), [react-redux-form](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form) or [react-form](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-form). However the goal of this tutorial is to show how forms actually work in React, by showing couple of different approaches and letting you choose what suits you best.
